# MathViz - A math visualizer you didn't need

I was thinking about visualizing math functions, and decided to implement, how hard could it be?

# Examples

Here are some examples that I could make:

![circle](examples/circle.png)
![tan(x)](examples/tan(x).png)
![atan(-x)](examples/atan(-x).png)

There are more in the [examples](examples) directory.
